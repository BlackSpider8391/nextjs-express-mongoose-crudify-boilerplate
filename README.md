# nextjs-express-mongoose-crudify-boilerplate

Based on [nextjs-express-boilerplate](https://github.com/johhansantana/nextjs-express-boilerplate), but with added [mongoose-crudify](https://github.com/ryo718/mongoose-crudify).


## Why is this awesome?

This is a great starting point for a any project where you want React (with server-side rendering, powered by [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js)) as frontend and Express/MongoDB as backend.


## How to use

Clone this repository:

	git clone https://github.com/tomsoderlund/nextjs-express-mongoose-crudify-boilerplate.git [MY_APP]

Install dependencies:

	cd [MY_APP]
	npm install  # or yarn install

Start it by doing the following:

	export MONGODB_URI=*your mongodb url* // you can get one for free at https://www.mlab.com/home
	npm run dev

In production:

	npm run build
	npm start

If you navigate to `http://localhost:3001/` you will see a [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) page with a list of kittens (or an empty list if you haven't added one).

You have your API server running at `http://localhost:3001/api/kittens`
